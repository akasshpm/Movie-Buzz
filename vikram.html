            <h1>General Details</h1>

            <p>Vikram is a 2022 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. Lokesh and Rathna Kumar worked together on the dialogues in this film. It is produced by Kamal Haasan who stars in the titular role, along with Vijay Sethupathi and Fahadh Faasil with Narain and Kalidas Jayaram in the supporting roles and Suriya in a cameo appearance. A spiritual successor of the 1986 film of the same name, it is the second installment in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe following Kaithi (2019).

                Kanagaraj was signed by Haasan's Raaj Kamal Films International for a proposed script in late 2019, with Rajinikanth planned in the lead role, but that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kanagaraj then announced another project for September 2020, featuring Haasan in the lead role as well as the producer. Its title Vikram was announced in November, and extensive pre-production work continued till early 2021. Principal photography began in July 2021 and ended in February 2022 with filming taking place across Tamil Nadu including Karaikudi, Chennai, Pondicherry, and Coimbatore. The soundtrack and score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander, with cinematography handled by Girish Gangadharan, and editing done by Philomin Raj.
                
                Vikram was released theatrically on 3 June 2022 to positive reviews from both the critics and audience, alike. The direction, performances of the cast (particularly those of Haasan, Sethupathi, and Faasil's), writing, soundtrack, cinematography, editing, and action sequences were highly praised. The film emerged as the all-time biggest blockbuster of Tamil cinema, turning out to be a massively profitable film for all investors involved. It is currently one of the highest-grossing Indian films worldwide.</p><br><br>

            <h1>Plot</h1>

            <p>After busting the consignment of Adaikalam and Anbu by Inspector Bejoy three months earlier, Police Chief Jose summons Amar and his black-ops team to bring justice to a group of masked vigilantes responsible for the deaths of Stephen Raj (following his arrest and subsequent release after being busted for helping Adaikalam and Anbu), ACP Prabhanjan and his foster father Karnan. Amar leads the investigation by digging into Karnan's life as his murder seems out of place because Karnan was an ordinary man, while the other two were higher officials in the NCB.

                Amar learns about Karnan's recent addiction to alcohol, drugs and prostitutes, and that he is very protective of his infant foster grandson. Amar also finds out about two missing containers of narcotics. Sandhanam, who runs a much bigger drug syndicate than Adaikalam, named Vetti Vagaiyara, is searching for the containers. His cold-blooded smuggler boss, 'Rolex', whose identity is unknown, was meant to receive the containers. Furthermore, Amar learns that Rolex would help Sandhanam form his government if the drugs get delivered. Otherwise, Rolex will kill Sandhanam and his family. Amar slowly figures out that all of Karnan's addictions are a ruse to cover up a highly covert operation he is running.
                
                Meanwhile, Veerapandian, a PWD officer and a contractor named Rudra Prathap plan to bring drug containers to Sandhanam. However, the masked vigilantes arrive and kill Veerapandian at a theatre. Amar and his team capture one of the vigilantes, revealed to be Bejoy. Bejoy reveals his family was killed for his role in leading the earlier drug bust, leading him to join the vigilantes. Amar and his team realise Rudra Prathap is the next target, and they sneak into Rudra Prathap's daughter's wedding ceremony. Rudra Prathap invites Sandhanam for protection. However, the masked men, along with their leader arrive at Rudra Prathap's daughter's wedding and threaten him. The leader drags Rudra Prathap and escapes on a bike, leaving the other members to deal with Sandhanam, but Sandhanam defeats them.
                
                Amar chases the leader down, who is revealed to be Karnan, having faked his death. Karnan kills Rudra Prathap by slitting his throat and escapes the police. Amar discloses to Jose that Karnan is actually Vikram, the former commander of the black ops squad's pilot batch of 1986. After a botched mission, the government hunted and brutally killed all squad members and their families, but Vikram and three other team members survived. Amar also figures that Jose is Sandhanam's mole in the department and is involved in Prabhanjan's death. Amar orchestrates a bomb blast at Sandhanam's house, which destroys his bungalow and drug lab. Jose informs Sandhanam in the nick of time, and everyone except Sandhanam's brother is evacuated from the blast site in time. Jose reveals Vikram and Amar's identities to Sandhanam.
                
                Vikram arrives at the prison and frees Bejoy and his team. Vikram reveals that the reason for actions is not vengeance over Prabhanjan's death but a mission to bust the drug syndicate in the city. He also admits that Prabhanjan is his own biological son. Sandhanam brutally kills Amar's wife Gayathri and sends his men to attack and kill Vikram's daughter-in-law and grandson at Prabhanjan's house. Vikram rushes to save them, but the gang kills a team member of Vikram's black ops squad and associate Agent Tina, who was disguised as the house help Valiamma. Vikram and his grandson reach Chennai Port, where the hidden containers are stored. Sandhanam learns about the containers' location and attacks Vikram. Vikram mows down Sandhanam's men with a cannon and an M2 Browning, but the remaining members of his black ops squad Uppiliappan and Lawrence die in the scuffle. After a fistfight, Vikram triggers a huge blast at the port that kills Sandhanam and destroys the drug containers.
                
                In an epilogue, in Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, Adaikalam and Anbu arrive with their men. They meet up with the gangsters affiliated with Sandhanam for a meeting with Rolex. Adaikalam and Anbu reveal Dilli's involvement in the Trichy drug ambush, and Sandhanam's men reveal Vikram and Amar's involvement in destroying their drug syndicate. It is shown that Amar joins Vikram's gang after Gayathri's death to continue the fight against drugs. Sandhanam's men reveal the current location of Dilli in Uttar Pradesh and Vikram's family in San Francisco. Rolex announces a massive bounty for the execution of Amar, Dilli, and Vikram's team. Unknown to everybody else, Vikram is also present at the meeting and walks away with determination after learning about the bounty placed on all of them.</p><br><br>
