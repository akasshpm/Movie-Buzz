            <h1>Plot</h1>

            <p>Muthuvel Pandian is a retired police officer who lives in Kodambakkam with his family. Muthuvel's son, ACP Arjun, is investigating Varman, an eccentric Malayali gangster who smuggles idols of gods and sells them to buyers overseas, operating from his base of operations in Arakkonam. Arjun confronts Varman's henchman, Seenu, and demands him about the whereabouts of Varman. As Arjun gets closer to nabbing Varman, he suddenly goes missing and the police department spreads word that he may have committed suicide to cover up that he was probably killed by Varman. Grieving the loss of his son and partly blaming himself for raising him to be honest and fearless, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and murders him, disposing of the body with the help of Vimal, a local taxi driver.

                Varman’s men make an attempt on Muthuvel's grandson, Rithvik, despite Muthuvel convincing Varman to leave him and his family alone. Enraged, Muthuvel decides to fight back and visits Narasimha, a reformed criminal living in Mandya, who loans him four of his sharpshooters. With the help of Narasimha’s men, Muthuvel blackmails and humiliates Varman, who then has a Bihari gangster, Kamdev, send people to kill Muthuvel and his family at his home, only for them to be gunned down. After discovering Varman's target to be Muthuvel, Kamdev reveals to him that Muthuvel was once the ruthless and charismatic jailer of Tihar prison, who was also known as "Tiger" Muthuvel Pandian. He disciplined the criminals harshly but also helped them reform, gaining a massive network of allies, including Kamdev. Muthuvel corners Varman in his base, but he reveals to him that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill him. Both of them ultimately arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in return for a famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Mangalagiri, Andhra Pradesh.
                
                Muthuvel plans a heist involving the Telugu actors, Blast Mohan, who is a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. Despite various deceptions and with the help of a smuggler in Mumbai named Mathew, Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it back to Varman, but it is later revealed that the crown he sent was a fake. Varman frees Arjun, who reveals himself as a dirty cop that wants to be cut in on Varman's operations, willing to kill his own father for money. However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera and their entire conversation is recorded and seen by Muthuvel. Muthuvel attacks Varman's hideout with Kamdev, Vimal, and his allies, killing Varman and his men, while Narasimha protects Muthuvel's family and Mathew destroys Varman’s smuggling operations. Muthuvel gives Arjun one last chance to surrender; however, he refuses and attempts to kill him. He is instead shot and killed by Narasimha's men, while Muthuvel solemnly walks away.</p><br><br>
